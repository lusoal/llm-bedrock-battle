# LLM Battle Bedrock

Welcome to LLM Battle Bedrock! This Python script implements a battle game where two AI-controlled characters, AmazonTitan and Jurassic, face off against each other. The game simulates strategic combat, with each character possessing distinct attributes that influence their performance in battle.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- AWS Credentials with Bedrock access

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the script llm-battle-bedrock.py in your terminal:

```
python llm-battle-bedrock.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to start the game and let AI make strategic decisions for each character.

## AI Models

This script serves as a platform for testing different AI models. Currently, it includes two AI models, **AmazonTitan** and **Jurassic**, which make decisions for the characters based on the game state and their predefined strategies.
